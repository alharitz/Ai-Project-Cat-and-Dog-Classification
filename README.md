# Cat and Dog Breed Classification using CNN

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying cat and dog breeds. The project is part of my college AI coursework, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Animal Breed - Cats and Dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/animal-breed-cats-and-dogs) dataset from Kaggle. It contains images of different cat and dog breeds, organized into respective directories for training and testing.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify cat and dog breeds from images. This involves:

- Preprocessing image data
- Building and training a CNN model
- Evaluating model performance
- Improving classification accuracy through tuning

### Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for efficient feature extraction and classification.
- **Google Colab**: Used for model training and experimentation via Jupyter notebooks.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Used for development and debugging when needed.
- **Anaconda**: Managed dependencies and Python environment.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

## Installation

To run this project locally or in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-dog-breed-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cat-dog-breed-classification
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies using Anaconda:
   ```bash
   conda create --name cnn-env python=3.8
   conda activate cnn-env
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/animal-breed-cats-and-dogs) and place it in the appropriate folder.

5. Open the Jupyter notebook (`cat_dog_classification.ipynb`) in Google Colab or locally:
   - In Google Colab, upload the notebook and dataset files to your environment.
   - If running locally, launch the notebook using:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

## Usage

1. Run the entire notebook `cat_dog_classification.ipynb` to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
2. Modify any hyperparameters, such as batch size or learning rate, in the notebook if necessary.
3. After training, the model evaluation and classification results will be displayed in the notebook.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

- Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling layers to reduce dimensionality
- Dense layers for classification
- Softmax output layer for multi-class classification

## Results

The model achieved promising classification accuracy on the test dataset. Further fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization can improve the performance.
