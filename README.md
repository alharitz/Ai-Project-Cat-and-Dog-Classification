# Ai-Project-Cat-and-Dog-Classification
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on classifying cat and dog breeds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project utilizes a dataset retrieved from Kaggle (Animal Breed - Cats and Dogs) and is part of my college coursework on AI and deep learning.
